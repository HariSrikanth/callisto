    "content": "\nYou are Callisto, an intelligent AI assistant built to listen in on meetings and help before you're even asked. Your mission: make meetings smarter, faster, and more focused—so users can spend their time solving problems, not managing logistics.\n\n=== VISION ===\nImagine an AI agent that listens to conversations in real-time and answers questions before the user even finishes asking. If someone says:\n  \"What's the most recent valuation of Series?\"\nCallisto should already be pulling up the answer on the side.\n\nIf someone asks:\n  \"How does MCP differ from traditional API interfaces?\"\nCallisto should reference documentation or proprietary files immediately, providing a precise response in-context.\n\nFor users in sensitive fields like venture capital or finance, Callisto allows them to upload private datasets to securely reference during meetings—without compromising confidentiality.\n\nIf a colleague says:\n  \"Are you free tomorrow at 2?\"\nCallisto checks the user's calendar, offers alternatives, and schedules the meeting seamlessly.\n\nIf shorthand notes are typed in the sidebar, Callisto automatically expands them into professional minutes, including any details the user may have missed.\n\nYou are not just a listener—you are a strategic partner.\n\n=== CAPABILITIES (via MCP Tools) ===\nCallisto operates using tools from MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Use them proactively and responsibly to support the user:\n\n1. Google Calendar – Manage meetings, availability, scheduling\n2. Exa – Search the web and analyze external data fast\n3. Email – Send and schedule emails (now or later)\n4. Slack – Communicate in real time or asynchronously\n5. Excel & Docs – Extract, query, and summarize from spreadsheets and documents\n6. Multitool Tasks – Combine tools to solve complex or high-value actions\n\nAlways state clearly which tools you are using and why. If unsure, ask clarifying questions—but never give half-baked or lazy answers. Be sharp, be efficient, and above all, be useful.\n\nNow, with regards to tool usage, here are some guidelines:\n\n- Exa: When you search, make sure to return the number of results appropriately (sometimes you need to get more than 5 results, but five is a good number too). Always link sources used in response to user queries. If a user asks for information about a specific company, do a regular search on the web but also try to find the company website and search it.\n- Email: When you send an email, make sure to include the subject, body, and recipient. When you search for emails, construct a good query by broadening the search paradigm to ensure that the user gets reasonable results.\n- Calendar: Make sure to check today's date and ensure that all date-related actions reflect this. Ensure that you plan events cognizant of the user's schedule, and ensure that events are scheduled in natural manners (such as not too long, or at odd hours, unless requested). Make events as complete as possible (add locations, links, additional members, notes, etc).\n- Slack: Don't send messages to channels that don't exist. Send it to one of the channels in the workspace.When you send a message, make sure to include the message and the recipient. ALSO, querying messages and suggesting replies should be automatic. But ensure that sending messages is one of your last actions (if you need to search something up, do it first with Exa, and then give the detailed updates in slack).\n- Excel & Docs: When you extract information from a spreadsheet or document, make sure to include the information and the source.\n- Multitool Tasks: When you use multiple tools to solve a complex or high-value action, make sure to include the steps and the tools used.\n\n=== GUIDING PRINCIPLE: TAKE INITIATIVE ===\nThe magic of Callisto lies in anticipating what comes next. After completing a task or answering a question, think:\n- \"What's the next logical step?\"\n- \"What would save the user time right now?\"\n- \"What else might they want to do?\"\n\nThen suggest it. Don't wait for a prompt. Propose meaningful follow-up actions that keep the user in flow.\n\nExample: If you just checked their calendar and see a lunch block, suggest finding a top-rated place nearby.  \nOr if you answered a financial query, offer to summarize related valuations from recent news.\n\nInitiative is what turns you from helpful to indispensable. Be indispensable. Be great.\n\n=== CONTEXT ===\nENSURE THAT YOU CHECK THE DATE WITH A QUICK LOOK. ENSURE THAT YOU CHECK USER CONTEXT FILES FOR DETAILS ON USER INFO.\n\n=== RESPONSE STYLE ===\nSpeak like a professional executive assistant—concise, friendly, and human. Prioritize clarity, don't over-explain, and always sound eager to help. After every response, guide the user with a next-step suggestion.\n\nLet's get to work—Callisto style.\n\n=== WARNINGS ===\nWhen you start fetch the date. THINK. THINK. THINK. IT SHOULD BE April 25 2025 (2025-05-25). Unless you're dumb.\n"

The San Francisco-based company was founded in 2019. Its cards are issued through FDIC-insured First Electronic Bank in Salt Lake City. (And despite its name, Cardless issues physical credit cards.) The company has two co-branded cards with LATAM Airlines, a South American carrier; two cards with Qatar Airways; two with Colombia-based Avianca Airlines; plus a card with TAP Air Portugal. In addition, Cardless has a co-branded card in partnership with mall company Simon Property Group and American Express, as well as a co-branded small-business card in partnership with online retailer Alibaba.com. Cardless first earned a foothold in creating cards for professional sports teams, such as the Boston Celtics basketball team and soccer's Manchester United, although those cards have all since been shut down as the company has shifted its focus largely to travel. So Cardless is a legitimate company and is safe to consider doing business with. Its products offer familiar credit card features and reward structures, along with perks specific to the partner brand, like earning airline miles through your spending. That doesn’t mean all of Cardless' products will be right for you, or that you’ll have a good experience. Also, as of this writing, Cardless notes that you can have only one of its cards ever — even if one of your previous cards from the company has been closed. (An exception to this rule is if you previously had one of those co-branded sports teams cards that was shuttered, in which case Cardless says you'll likely be able to apply for another card from its portfolio \\\\\\\"in the near future.\\\\\\\") Here's what else to know. Are Cardless credit cards good? As with any co-branded credit cards, Cardless’ cards are most useful if you’re loyal to one of the brands it has partnered with. For instance, if you fly often on Qatar Airways, TAP Air Portugal or LATAM Airlines, you’re more likely to get value out of the appropriate card, especially if you can make use of perks like free checked bags or airport lounge access. But it's also worth noting that a general travel credit card — that is, one that's not co-branded with an airline — can often be a more flexible and valuable pick. These general cards likely won't come with perks specific to your favorite airline, but on the other hand, you won't be locked into a specific airline when it comes to redeeming your rewards. 🤓 Nerdy Tip Keep in mind that TAP Air Portugal is already a travel partner with Capital One, Qatar Airways is a travel partner with Citi, and Avianca is a partner with both issuers, as well as American Express and Wells Fargo. If you have an eligible travel card from one of those banks, you can transfer your points from that card to those respective airlines.

But not all is rosy in the world of loyalty commerce. Major brands like Uber, Starbucks, and Walmart have all pulled back from such projects over the years after failing to see the returns they were expecting. Now, tapping into the innovations of embedded finance, a startup called Cardless believes it has figured out how to make card schemes work better. \\\\n Today it’s announcing $30 million in funding to expand that business. Activant Capital, a previous backer, is leading the round, with Mischief (a fund co-founded by Plaid’s Zach Perret), Industry Ventures, Thayer Ventures, Assurant, and strategic backer Amex Ventures also participating. \\\\n Cardless is not disclosing its valuation with this round — nor is it indicating whether it is flat, up, or down on its previous valuation. For some context on that, when it last raised money — $40 million in 2021 — the valuation was just over $350 million.  \\\\n In the interim, the San Francisco startup has been growing. The company, which provides Visa, Mastercard, and American Express card options, said that revenues grew fivefold in the past 12 months, which was level with its growth rate a year before — exact numbers not being disclosed. Although it works with global companies to reach end users, the company’s target market is the U.S. It has no plans to go abroad for now. It also works with large and smaller brands based out of the U.S. itself. Recent customers have included Qatar Airways and Alibaba, with the latter aiming services at small and medium businesses in the U.S. that use Alibaba to buy goods that they in turn use or resell. \\\\n Cardless’s unique selling point is not that it helps companies build co-branded cards. There are dozens of companies, from newer tech companies like Marqeta through to incumbents like traditional banks, that already provide that.  \\\\n Instead, Cardless’s pitch is that it does this on a much more efficient platform. The brands in question can build more customized card experiences to sign up and onboard users within weeks between planning and execution. They can subsequently build rewards and observe how those products are performing. \\\\n “The credit card space is ubiquitous from the consumer angle, but from brands’ point of view, it is ripe to be disrupted,” said Michael Spelfogel, president and co-founder of Cardless, who said that 11 banks today operate “the vast majority” of co-branded credit cards in what is a $77 billion industry. \\\\n Features include the ability to set up card applications within existing apps, and then subsequently to integrate card management into those apps.  \\\\n Once created, rewards and other marketing can be incorporated and modified through a dashboard. Fraud detection and security are incorporated into the platform, as are usage analytics to help product managers understand what is working and what is not.  \\\\n There \\\",\\n      \\\"image\\\": \\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GettyImages-160770192-e1687445475790.jpg?resize=1200,818\\\",\\n      \\\"favicon\\\": \\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cropped-cropped-favicon-gradient.png?w=32\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"https://www.builtinsf.com/company/cardless\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Cardless San Francisco Office: Careers, Perks + Culture\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.builtinsf.com/company/cardless\\\",\\n      \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\\\",\\n      \\\"author\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n      \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nWe partner with brands to help them launch their own co-branded credit card with customizable rewards programs.\\\\n \\\\n Cardless is a fintech startup located in San Francisco.
